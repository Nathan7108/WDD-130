            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm an 19 year old studen pursuing a computer science degree. 
                I love coding, hiking and exploring, and spending time with my friends. I have a little over a year of experience in backend development and AI, with only a few months of front end and web devlopment. Currently I am working on a project in reac where I take my OpenAI key and have it analyze and responde to various products and how they impact the enviroment around us. I think this class will help with that a lot. I'm excited to see how I can improve my frontend skills, and build good habits when it comes to web development.
