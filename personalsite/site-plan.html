      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>People will come to my site to learn more about me and the work I have done. It will be a simple and easy-to-use place where they can see my projects, skills, and background all in one spot. Visitors will likely have questions such as who I am, what kind of projects I have worked on, and how they can contact me. My site will answer these questions by providing a short introduction about me, a section that highlights my best projects, and a way for people to reach out if they want to connect. Some visitors may just be curious, while others, such as potential employers or collaborators, may want to see my experience and skills in detail. Visitors will probably want to look through my projects, read about what I have done, and possibly find links to learn more about each project. My site will make this easy by organizing everything clearly, so people can quickly find what they are looking for. They wonâ€™t have to click through too many pages or search for information. Everything will be straightforward and easy to access. The site will also include a section about my background, giving visitors a better idea of who I am and what I enjoy working on. A contact section will allow them to easily reach out if they are interested in working with me or just want to connect. The goal is for people to get a good understanding of my work and skills in just a few minutes. My site will help me share my projects in a professional and friendly way while making it simple for visitors to explore and find what they need.
